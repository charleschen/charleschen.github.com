<p>  Migrated my site from <a href="www.charleschen.github.com">charleschen.github.com</a> to <a href="www.charleschen.com">charleschen.com</a> using rsync.  Also learning to use Rakefiles to automate my tasks. </p>

<p>  I've been studying Ruby on Rails lately.  Interesting language.  I probably try out some projects, will post them soon </p>
