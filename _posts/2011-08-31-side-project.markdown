<p> Been a while since i last posted, been learning a lot and keeping busy!  Recently started on a side project, it consists of collecting statics from social networks.  It's pretty interesting learning these metrics, the world is coming to a point where social media is not just something for fun anymore.  It's become a integral part of our lives </p>

<p> For version control, I have been using GIT.  Although I say I use it, I'm still only doing the simple stuff of git.  But it's nice and along with github it's a great way to back up your code and its process.  For deployment I've chosen Heroku, simply because pushing the project from my computer to github, then to heroku is so simple.  Only trouble I had so far was when I needed to switch the cedar stack for Heroku, there were some problems of me not having postgreSQL on my local machine.  But I solved that with a simple search on google.</p>

<p> I'll update on the progress of the project as I go.  Peace outttt.</p>
