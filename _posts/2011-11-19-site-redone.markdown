	Thanks to a cup of coffee at 10:30 PM, i was able to finish restyling of my blog.  I will never drink coffee that late ever again.  Past couple of month has been crazy.  Couple of projects in the work, will post about problems I've had in the past, how I solved it, and useful ruby gems I've come across.
